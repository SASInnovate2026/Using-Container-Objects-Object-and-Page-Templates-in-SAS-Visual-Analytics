1. View the report using a small screen size and a large screen size.

   Does the report layout change?

   <p><details>
   <summary>Click to expand/collapse for solution</summary>

   **Solution:**
   1. Adjust the window to view the report on a small screen.

      ![SmallScreenFixedReportSize](images/140_701_SmallScreenFixedReportSize.png)

      Because the report size is fixed and the screen is smaller than the report, scrollbars appear on the left and bottom of the report.

   1. Adjust the window to view the report on a large screen.

      ![LargeScreenFixedReportSize](images/140_701_LargeScreenFixedReportSize.png)

      No. Because the report size is fixed, the report layout does not adjust.
